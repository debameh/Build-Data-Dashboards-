The third on the list is Florida with 7.18% and is closely followed byNewYork which accounts for 7.02% of BIPOC.
### Design Comment:
BIPOC stands for Black,Indegenious and People of colour. It is agrouping term for the ethinic minorities in the U.S. This was calculated by adding up the percentages of Asians,Blacks,Natives and Hispanic and multiplying against the total population for each county and country. It was useful in seeing differences between minorities and Whites. This information was represented using the map visual to show the location of these states and proximity to each other.
